# MEDICAL MANAGEMENT PORTAL 

This project is a web-based Medical Management System designed to manage patient information, handle medicine orders, and streamline the ordering process. The application consists of several key pages: a login page, a dashboard, a form to add patient details, and a checkout page. The dashboard includes functionality to search for medicines using an API, and the checkout page allows users to place orders for the medicines.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.0.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js and npm:** Angular projects require Node.js and npm to be installed. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Angular CLI:** The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is used for generating components, services, modules, and more. Install it globally using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
  
- **Understanding of TypeScript:** Angular is built with TypeScript, so having a basic understanding of TypeScript will be beneficial.

- **Code Editor:** You'll need a code editor to work with the project files. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or WebStorm.

- **Git:** Some familiarity with Git version control will be helpful.
